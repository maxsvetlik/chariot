# CANSimple

This folder contains the CANSimple database file that was compiled and distributed by ODrive Robotics for a particular firmware version. It is used to build a schema by the CanSimpleInterface class.

In general you have no reason to edit files in this folder. In the event of a firmware upgrade, it is worth checking if any update to the database file is required. The file is pulled from [ODrive's github](https://www.github.com/odriverobotics/ODrive). It was pulled into this repository only to have a stable reference from which to work from, in the event a new version is pushed to their public repo.
